# a11y-resources - a starter pack
Despite (or perhaps due to) the wealth of accessibility guidance available on the web, we've found ourselves recreating the same set of curated resources within each company we visit. We've decided to make a public version for everyone to reference, no matter where you work or what you work on.

## First, what's "a11y"?
**a11y** is a [numeronym](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeronym) for **accessibility**. You'll find this shorthand a lot on the web, particularly as a [hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/a11y)!

## Table of Contents / Using this guide

We've organized specific resources around design, engineering (mainly web, some mobile), and content into their respective folders. Check out their `readme`s for more detail.
