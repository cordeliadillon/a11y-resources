# A11y for Digital Product Design

## Concept #1: Perceivable

In short, ensure:
* sufficient contrast
* adequate font size and scalability for different devices
* focus styles are present

## Concept #2: Consistent and Intuitive

* avoid time-limiting behaviors
* avoid automatic actions; changes should only be explicitly triggered by user actions
* ensure the UX is consistent (e.g. next/back buttons always go to the same places)
